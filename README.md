- Every bug fixing developer, generally uses FIREMEM, QUERY CENTER, ADT & SPLUNK. 
- We spend quite a few time to perform login, navigating, & clicking on many elements. Also since its get timedout, we have to go to start from ToolCenter everytime.
- This extension helps to trigger firemem, querying a user, code push in ADT & opening splunk stats from anywhere & quite faster.
- It is coded with intelligence where depending on the developer's usages, it displays Cobrands & Queries which he/she uses frequently as displayed in QC.
